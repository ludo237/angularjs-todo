## Why this project ? ##

**This project is no longer maintan**

I'd to improve myself, and so you should (LoL). For most of my career as a javascript font-end developer, I relied on the jQuery library, which is awesome by the way, however, I was never fully satisfied.

I noticed this thing especially with the increasing difficulty of the projects, jQuery became almost a forced solution, a patch to restore my limited knowledge of Javascript, I admit.

So I took the plunge and I told my self:

	«I must learn how to control the workflow of my javascript code,
	 but with a clean and professional way»
	 
## Why AngularJs ? ##

Just because. There're a lot of frameworks out there but AngularJs inspired me from the beginning. Clean code, clean API, it comes from Google and there's a great community and you can find tutorials, videos and source code almost everywhere so I choose it.
